======================
VIM Configuration Repo
======================

This repo was inspired by http://rawpackets.com/2011/10/16/configuring-vim-as-a-python-ide/,
with a few changes.  Because of these changes.  I will explain them briefly, then provide any
appropriate instructions below that.

Changes
-------
pyflakes
  pyflakes wasn't found by apt, so I had to add debian's experimental repsitory as a source.

Lusty
  Requires vim to be compiled with Ruby interpretation, and I didn't want to.  Using NerdTree instead. 

pep8
  Wouldn't work for.  I opted instead to installe Flake8 and use the vim-flake8 plugin 

color-sampler-pack
  This repo was renamed.  It's only needed if you desire to have different color schemes in vim to choose from.  If you don't want to use this, you don't need the scrollColors plugin either.  But I kept both because they're cool.  I just had to update the plugin name to install it correctly.

snipMate
  I just didn't want this, so I removed it.  If you want auto-complete help, you can install this yourself, the instructions from the rawpacks page will work for this plugin.

virtualenv
  I didn't want this so I removed it.


Dependencies
------------
Follow these instructions instead of the instructions on the rawpackets page.  This replaces the Dependencies section there.

1. sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list ~/sources.list.backup
2. echo " deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian experimental main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list 
3. sudo apt-get install pyflakes
4. sudo pip install Flake8
5. Also, don't forget to create a symbolic link to .vimrc as described in the rawpacks page.

New Plugins List
----------------
Although the plugins are provided already in this repo as submodules, this is what the list of commands
would look like if you were doing this from scratch::

    git submodule add https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen.git bundle/pathogen
    git submodule add https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8.git bundle/vim-flake8
    git submodule add https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree bundle/nerdtree
    git submodule add https://github.com/sjl/gundo.vim.git bundle/gundo
    git submodule add https://github.com/vim-scripts/Colour-Sampler-Pack.git bundle/color-sampler-pack
    git submodule add https://github.com/vim-scripts/ScrollColors.git bundle/scrollColors
    git submodule add https://github.com/andrewle/vim-autoclose.git bundle/vim-autoclose
    git submodule add https://github.com/ervandew/supertab.git bundle/supertab
    git submodule add https://github.com/vim-scripts/pydoc.vim.git bundle/pydoc
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    git submodule foreach git submodule init
    git submodule foreach git submodule update

Installing submodules
---------------------
There's an executable file include in the repo called update_all.  When you want to install a new vim
plugin that has a github repo, simple do this from the root .vim directory::

    git submodule add [HTTPS clone URL] bundle/[package name]
    ./update_all

Uninstalling submodules
-----------------------

To remove submodules, do the following:

1. Delete the relevant line from the .gitmodules file.
2. Delete the relevant section from .git/config.
3. Run git rm â€“cached path_to_submodule
4. Commit and delete the now untracked submodule files.

A couple of cool things so far 
------------------------------

Flake8
  This is a big deal.  Open any python file and just press F7, it will show all the pep8 violations in the current file.


ScrollColors
  This thing is totally fun.  In the past, when trying to find a good color scheme for vim, I've found various pages that list each theme with screenshots, but they never look exactly like they do on my machine.  This module allows you to open up a python file and scroll through each color theme from the clour-sampler-pack.  Just open up a python file and this this::

:SCROLL

Then press up and down to see all the different themes.  To use that theme permanently, you must add it to your .vimrc file using the "colorscheme" option.


Gundo
  I didn't realize vim kept such good track of changes.  In typical editors, if you type something, undo it, then type something else, it's practically impossible to go back to what what typed before the first undo.  But vim keeps track of all of this, and Gundo is a great tree-like navigation of all that.  To test it:

| Open a file with vim
| type something
| press "u" to undo it
| type something else
| press "u" to undo it
| type something else
| press F5 to see all the changes, and just navigate through.  When you get to the change you want to have back, just press "Enter."
